# Teach Yourself Data Analytics in 30 Days

The contents of this repo are meant to support you as you work through the chapters that make up [https://stories.thedataproject.net/](the free online curriculum in my Data Project). 

The Jupyter Notebooks might not always deliver exactly the same results shown on the website - or in the [book version](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1777721008). That might be because your local Python version isn't completely compatible with the one I used. 

But whatever the cause, it's a good thing, because it'll force you to understand exactly what the code is doing and how it interacts with its host environment. 

Good luck!
